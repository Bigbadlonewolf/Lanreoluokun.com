---

## The scenario

A regional bank runs its customer-facing payment API on-premises. Leadership wants the workload on GCP within 90 days. The regulator requires evidence that cardholder data is segmented, and that privileged access to production is time-bound and auditable. The migration team is three people.

## The decision, sentence one

**Tokenize PAN at capture, before it enters bank infrastructure, and make the access-grant lifecycle its own evidence.** The payment service provider handles cardholder data; the bank handles tokens. Privileged access runs through a tracked, time-boxed workflow whose audit log is the regulator's proof.

## Scope

**In:** the payment API tier and its data path, the cardholder data environment boundary, the privileged access model for production, evidence generation for both regulatory requirements, and hybrid connectivity back to on-premises core banking.

**Out:** the core banking system, which stays on-premises. Database replatforming. Every other workload. A 90-day window that attempts more than this delivers nothing.

## Constraints

- **90 days.** Sequential strategies fail by construction. Design and evidence collection run in parallel from week one.
- **Team of three.** Every design choice gets taxed for operational cost. At this staffing level, managed services beat self-managed almost every time.
- **Migration, not greenfield.** The API keeps serving customers while it moves, and it keeps a dependency back to core banking on-premises.
- **The regulator is a primary stakeholder.** Evidence is a design output, not something produced in a panic the week before an audit.

## Trust boundaries

1. **Customer device to internet.** Nothing on the far side is controlled. Clients are assumed hostile.
2. **Internet to GCP edge.** Inspection, rate limiting and DDoS absorption live here, at the provider edge and Cloud Armor, not at the API gateway.
3. **Edge to service tier.** Authenticated, authorized, logged.
4. **Service tier to cardholder data environment.** The compliance boundary. The design goal is to make this boundary defend itself by shrinking what sits behind it.
5. **Service tier to on-premises core banking.** The hybrid link. No PAN crosses it — only tokenized payment references and settlement instructions.
6. **The admin plane.** Every human who can touch production is a trust boundary with a name on it. This one gets its own design, not a bullet point.

## Assumptions

1. **The bank may not need to store PAN at all.** If a payment service provider can tokenize at capture, the cardholder data environment shrinks toward zero. This is the highest-value question in the engagement and it gets verified in week one.
2. **A GCP organization with at least a minimal landing zone exists.** If it does not, standing one up is week-one work rather than an afterthought. Every control below inherits its posture from that foundation.
3. **The bank acts as a merchant, not an issuer or acquirer.** If it is an issuer with PAN storage obligations, the tokenization assumption changes and the cardholder data environment cannot collapse to zero.

## Design commitments

**1. Single managed ingress.** A managed API gateway fronts the API, with Cloud Armor at the provider edge for DDoS and Layer 7 filtering.

*Rejected:* a self-managed gateway (Kong, Envoy on GCE or GKE). A three-person team cannot safely operate ingress infrastructure and execute a migration at the same time. The risk is not the build. It is the operate.

**2. Tokenization at the payment service provider, before PAN reaches bank infrastructure.** Payment fields are served directly from the PSP through hosted fields or a client SDK. The raw card number travels from the customer's device over TLS straight into the PSP's vault, the vault returns a token, and the client submits the token. Every bank-side system, gateway, service tier, database and log sees tokens only. De-tokenization for settlement happens inside the PSP's vault, on the PSP's compliance scope.

That answers the regulator's first question by construction. With no PAN in the environment, the cardholder data environment collapses to the integration boundary, and the segmentation obligation is met by architecture rather than by compartmentalization alone.

DLP then moves to its correct job. It is not there to block exfiltration. It is there to prove the negative: continuous scanning for card-number patterns turns "no PAN exists in our systems" from an assertion into a monitored, logged, testable claim.

Hosted fields reduce the bank's PCI scope. They do not remove it. The bank still owns script-integrity monitoring (PCI DSS v4.0 6.4.3) and change detection (11.6.1) on the payment page itself. Those go into the compliance evidence pipeline rather than being assumed away by the PSP integration.

*Governance of the PSP dependency.* The PSP is a revenue-critical third party, so the contract carries a 99.9% availability SLA with a penalty, an exit clause covering data portability and a 90-day transition, and a fallback path — a secondary PSP or a stored-token retry queue. Business owner: Head of Digital Payments. If the PSP is down, payments stop. That is accepted, documented, and the fallback is tested quarterly.

*Rejected:* running an in-house token vault. Full control and no provider dependency, at the cost of owning a regulated CDE with its own segmentation, monitoring and assessment scope. A three-person team cannot carry that in 90 days.

{{< diagram src="dc1-tokenized-data-path" caption="The whole argument is the horizontal line. **The card number never crosses it**, so the cardholder data environment sits inside the provider's compliance scope and the bank's segmentation obligation is met by the shape of the design rather than by compartmentalising a problem it chose to keep." >}}

**3. Zero standing privileged access, with elevation that expires on its own.** Engineers hold read-only roles by default. Elevation runs through a tracked workflow: a request, a recorded approval from a second person, a time-boxed grant scoped by IAM Condition to the one resource in question, and every request, approval, grant and expiry written to an append-only ledger. Break-glass exists for real emergencies, needs two people, alarms on use, and gets reviewed the next morning.

**Mechanism test.**

- *Who:* the engineer requests through a tracked GitHub issue.

**Enforced by what:** the PAM entitlement. `max_request_duration` bounds the grant and PAM expires it natively, no running process required. Activation gated on approver justification from an approver group that is not `eligible_users`.

**Evidenced by what artifact:** admin-activity logs for the grant, plus the broker's append-only ledger recording the verified OIDC identity and `auth_time`. The ledger's `approved_by` is self-asserted from the POST body and is not the SoD control; the PAM approval workflow is.

One detail here is worth more than the rest of the design, because it is the part I got wrong first.

The reference build originally carried its own revocation function. I deleted it. Google's Privileged Access Manager expires the grant on its own, which left a second revocation path whose only remaining justification was that it already existed. What replaced it is a read-only reconciliation job that sweeps for grants outliving their window and writes a flag to the ledger.

That job detects an overrun. It does not contain one. Nothing is revoked automatically, and that is a decision rather than a gap. Automated revocation is an action taken against a production access-control plane, and an action needs an alerting and rollback story before it runs unattended. So the claim I can defend to a regulator is "detected inside roughly one sweep," not "contained in fifteen minutes." Two different sentences, and only one of them is true.

What survives is the useful part: the audit log of the grant lifecycle *is* the regulator's evidence. The control and the proof are the same artifact, which is the strongest available answer to "time-bound and auditable."

{{< diagram src="dc1-grant-lifecycle" caption="The struck-through box is the part worth defending in an interview. Two enforcement paths that can disagree is how you get an incident where each one assumes the other handled it, so the second path was deleted rather than kept for having already been written. What replaced it **detects and does not contain**, which is a narrower claim and a true one." >}}

*Rejected:* bastion hosts with standing SSH access. Unauditable standing privilege, which fails the second regulatory requirement by design.

The reference build scaffolded Terraform IAM bindings with a CEL expiry condition in v1 — disabled by default (`count = 0`), never applied, never deployed. Replaced by GCP PAM's `max_request_duration` (ADR-005). Shown here as the design the build rejected.

**4. Continuous compliance evidence.** Infrastructure changes pass policy-as-code evaluation in CI before merge, the pattern built in [Compliance as Code](https://github.com/Bigbadlonewolf/COMPLIANCE_AS_CODE): PCI DSS v4.0, SOC 2 and NIST 800-53 mappings, gated jobs, blocking on violation. Compliance posture becomes continuous and version-controlled instead of annual and screenshot-based.

**Mechanism test.**

- *Who:* a developer pushes an infrastructure change.
- *Through what:* a GitHub Actions workflow running Rego policies against the Terraform plan JSON.
- *Enforced by:* required status checks on the default branch, admin merge bypass disabled at the organisation level, and a policy violation blocking the apply.
- *Evidenced by:* CI run logs and plan artifacts in an immutable artifact repository, each mapped to a control requirement — storage bucket encryption to PCI DSS v4.0 3.4.1, and so on.

The limit belongs in the design document rather than in a footnote discovered later. A policy engine reading Terraform plan output can enforce "you must declare a value." It cannot enforce "that value is truthful," because verifying that needs runtime knowledge the plan JSON does not contain. Anything in that gap needs a different control, not a weaker version of this one.

**5. Hybrid connectivity without PAN transit.** The dependency on on-premises core banking runs over Dedicated Interconnect with redundant VPN fallback. No PAN crosses that link — only tokenized payment references and settlement instructions. The trust boundary is the integration layer, not the network.

**Mechanism test.**

- *Who:* a platform engineer configures the integration.
- *Through what:* Dedicated Interconnect and Cloud Router, with an application-layer message format where the PAN field carries the PSP token instead.
- *Enforced by:* VPC firewall rules blocking outbound traffic except to known on-premises endpoints on known ports, plus schema validation at the integration layer that rejects any message whose PAN field passes a Luhn check as a real card number.
- *Evidenced by:* VPC Flow Logs and DLP inspection of the integration message store, showing zero PAN matches across the hybrid link over a rolling 90 days.

*Rejected:* extending the on-premises CDE into GCP. That expands the assessment scope rather than shrinking it, which is the opposite of what the 90 days is for.

## The risk statement

A failed segmentation assessment means failed audits, card-brand penalties, and a breach blast radius where one compromised credential becomes a reportable event.

**Derivation.** Card-brand non-compliance assessment ($50K–$500K per incident), plus PCI forensic investigation ($150K–$400K), plus state breach notification at $5–$20 per record across 150,000 cards ($750K–$3M), plus OCC or FDIC enforcement ($1M–$10M for wilful non-compliance).[^1] Total **$2M–$14M, midpoint around $8M**, against controls whose incremental cost is a fraction of that.

The two decisions compound. Even a fully compromised admin credential lands in an environment holding no card numbers. Each control shrinks the other's worst case, which is the argument for doing both rather than picking the cheaper one.

## Reversal triggers

This design is superseded, not patched, if any of these is true by day 30.

1. **The PSP cannot tokenize at capture** and offers only server-side tokenization. The CDE does not collapse, and the bank has to build segmentation controls — VPC isolation, encryption, DLP — that 90 days may not support.
2. **The bank turns out to be an issuer with PAN storage obligations.** Tokenizing at capture does not remove an issuing CDE. The design shifts to vaulting and segmentation, and the 90-day scope is at risk.
3. **The landing zone does not exist and cannot be stood up in week one.** Every downstream control inherits from that foundation. Without it, the timeline moves.

## Acceptance criteria

1. **The negative, proven.** A continuous DLP sweep across GCP storage and logs returns zero PAN matches for 30 consecutive days. Evidence: the scan report with timestamp and scope.
2. **Grant lifecycle under load.** An engineer requests production access, receives it, and the grant expires. The ledger shows request → approval → grant → expiry with no orphaned IAM bindings, and the reconciliation sweep flags nothing. Evidence: an immutable Cloud Logging query.
3. **The compliance gate bites.** A deliberately non-compliant change — an unencrypted storage bucket — is pushed and blocked before merge by a required status check, with admin bypass disabled and tested. Evidence: the failed CI run artifact.
4. **PSP fallback works.** The quarterly test routes a transaction through the secondary PSP or the stored-token retry path. Evidence: the completed test transaction.

## First steps

Week one: verify the PAN-storage assumption and whether the bank is merchant or issuer, stand up or validate the landing zone, put the on-premises connectivity question on the table, open the PSP contract review including SLA, exit clause and fallback, and switch on script-integrity monitoring and change detection for the payment page.

The $1M–$10M range used here for a bank of roughly $2B in assets is extrapolated from larger enforcement actions rather than drawn from a comparable-size precedent, and the actual figure in any specific case turns on severity, duration and wilfulness.
